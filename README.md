###### Indiana State Museum
The museum's collection was displayed in a spacious room on the third floor of the **State Capitol** building in 1888, but it did not remain there for long. It was frequently moved from room to room until 1919 when the collection was sent to a most inhospitable place, **the basement of the Statehouse**.
